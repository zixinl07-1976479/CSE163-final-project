We highly recommend use **The JetBrains Datelore** to reproduce our project. Raw datasets needed in this project could be found and download in [Olympics data in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), and [country data in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region) for free. Or you can get all the datasets we've processed and the full code via [Github](https://github.com/zixinl07-1976479/CSE163-final-project). Upload all needed csv files in _Attached files_ section typing 'upload' in The JetBrains Datelore. To run the whole program, _pandas_, _seaborn_, _numpy_, _plotly_, and _matplotlib_ libraries need to be installed in library manager of The JetBrains Datelore. To save image with _plotly_, the _kaleido_ package should be installed using `$ pip install -U kaleido` in terminal or search and install in library manager2. Running the code from final_code.py in the code cell would create all necessary csv files and automatically save all images into png figures. To preview images with _plotly_, one could uncomment `fig.show()` typing command+/ (for MacOS) or control+/ (for Windows) in the script.
